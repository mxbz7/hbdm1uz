            <p style="font-size:10px;">Happy 19 Birthday Miraj😘  Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate you and also reflect on everything that makes you the incredible person you are, wait don't exit messages will be visible.. 
                I waited 5 days, you can wait few seconds for me. And do not exit, until I say😅</p>

            <p style="font-size:9px;"> I know you’re angry with me for my mistake, and I can’t express enough how sorry I am for whatever I’ve done to hurt you. I never intended to bring any harm or negativity into your life.</p>

            <p style="font-size:9px;"> I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting, and I feel ashamed because I value our friendship deeply. You’ve always been more than just a friend to me—you’re family. I just want you to know that I never meant to let you down, and I hope, someday, you can forgive me.</p>

            <p style="font-size:9px;">As you pursue your law degree, I want to remind you how capable and brilliant you are. The road may seem tough at times, but I know you’ve got what it takes to overcome every challenge. You’ve always been someone with great determination, and I truly believe you’ll become one of the finest lawyers out there. Your career is just the beginning of an amazing journey, and I want you to know that I’m always rooting for your success.</p>

            <p style="font-size:9px;">Even if we don’t talk like we used to, I’m still here for you. One message from you, and I’ll be there, no matter what. You’re never alone in this journey, and I’ll always have your back, no matter the distance or time.</p>

            <p style="font-size:9px;">I miss those times we spent together, especially the nights playing Free Fire. I’ve left the game, and my ID might be offline, but the memories of us playing together, strategizing, and laughing endlessly are something I’ll always cherish</p>



            <p style="font-size:9px;">And Burdwan—oh, those days! The sleepless nights, the jokes, the stories—we created memories that will stay with me forever. We were unstoppable back then, weren’t we? Even Sir Sanjib couldn’t stop talking about us. We were his most wanted students, and he saw something unique in us. </p>
            <p style="font-size:9px;">He believed in us, and I know he would be so proud of how far you’ve come. Life isn’t always easy, I know. But I want you to remember that tough times don’t last forever. You are stronger than you realize, and everything you’re going through right now will eventually get better.</p>

            <p style="font-size:9px;">Allah is always with you, watching over you and guiding your path. Keep your faith strong, because Allah never tests a soul beyond what it can bear. Trust His plan, and you’ll see that everything will fall into place at the right time.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;"> Miraj, you’re not alone in this world, and I’ll always care about you. No matter how far apart life takes us or how much time passes, you’ll always have a friend in me..</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Idk how long this message will be, but it will be interesting I guess. I may not exist next year to wish you again in the same way, or maybe a more unexpected and cooler and –98°C cool way. I made this website from past 5 days for you</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">And yes, happy birthday again and again and again. I'm happy for you. You turned 19, you happy me also happy Your heart has beaten 665,000,000 💓 times in 19 years, and by the time you're reading this message, it has increased by a couple more hundred times📈. In those 19 years, your heart has felt different feelings, sorrow, grief, joy, regret, happiness but still working fine. It healed by itself. It still works. I love it, how it works 24*7 non stop.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I love you bro, its 12am if you are reading this just after i sent you. I don't know how many people will wish you, who will wish you I don't know, but i think my message is the first that you received.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Im sorry if I said anything unwanted haha. You know I'm not a mind reader but, I can assure you that you are reading this message in your mind but, in my voice👀. Sala cartoon 🤣</p>



<p style="font-size:16px;"> On this birthday, I wish you nothing but happiness, success, and endless blessings. May all your dreams come true, and may you find peace and joy in the journey ahead. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">You deserve the world, my friend. Keep shining, keep believing, and never give up.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">I LOVE YOU🤝 ❤️
You can leave this site now. Everything wanted to say, is said. </p>
